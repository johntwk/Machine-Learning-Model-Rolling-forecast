# Machine-Learning-Model-Rolling-forecast

## Description
This repository contains a program to use the **rolling_grid_search.py** in the repository [Python-ML-rolling-grid-search](https://github.com/johntwk/Python-ML-rolling-grid-search).
In particular, **ML_implementation_parallel.py** 

1. Implement hyperparameter selection/re-selection and rolling forecast with parallel programming

2. Store the actual exchange rates, the predicted exchange rates, the score of the forecasts, hyperparameters, labels and features as .json file and .csv file
